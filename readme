Hello! If you're reading this, you've clicked on the link in my about me. 

To use the Application, simply install python locally on your system, (you can figure it out I'm sure), Then click on "client.py"
in this github, and either Download it, or "copy paste" it into a file named similarly. 

Then? 
It'll ask "what server would you like to connect to." 

simply copy paste or type 
173.255.232.168
and press enter

type your name, and BOOM.

you've now been connected to the server.


If you have any technical problems or suggestions, Text 207-500-9082. 

eventually I ***will*** be adding more features and updating this Readme as things go on. 

So... ENJOY!!
